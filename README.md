### Description
- **data/**: Contains raw and preprocessed datasets.
  - **raw/**: Stores the original datasets.
  - **preprocessed/**: Stores cleaned and processed datasets ready for analysis.
- **models/**: Placeholder for machine learning models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and visualization.
- **outputs/**: Directory for storing output files such as reports or results.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and other utilities.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and structure overview.

### File Descriptions

- **scripts/preprocess.py**: This script handles data preprocessing tasks, including:
  - Replacing missing values in numerical columns with their mean.
  - Removing duplicate rows.
  - Standardizing categorical values (e.g., trimming and converting to lowercase).
  - Filtering rows based on specific conditions (e.g., removing rows with negative sales).
  - Normalizing numerical columns using min-max scaling.
  - Saving the cleaned and normalized dataset to `data/preprocessed/cleaned_marketing_and_product_performance.csv`.

- **notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb**: This notebook provides an interactive environment for:
  - **Loading Data**: Imports libraries, loads the preprocessed dataset, and displays the first few rows.
  - **Dataset Overview**:
    - Displays dataset information (e.g., column data types, non-null counts).
    - Provides summary statistics for numerical columns.
  - **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and standardizes categorical values.
    - Filters rows based on specific conditions (e.g., removing rows with negative sales).
  - **Data Visualizations**:
    - **Heatmap of Missing Values**: Visualizes missing data patterns.
    - **Distribution of Numerical Columns**: Histograms with KDE for numerical columns.
    - **Revenue Generated vs Budget**: Scatter plot with `Subscription_Tier` as a hue.
    - **Average Customer Satisfaction by Common Keywords**: Bar plot showing satisfaction scores.
    - **Units Sold by Discount Level**: Box plot comparing units sold across discount levels.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project provides insights into marketing campaigns, product performance, and customer behavior. It includes the following key columns:

- **Campaign_ID**: Unique identifier for each marketing campaign.
- **Product_ID**: Unique identifier for products involved in the campaigns.
- **Budget**: The allocated budget for each campaign.
- **Clicks**: Number of clicks generated by the campaign.
- **Conversions**: Number of successful conversions (e.g., purchases) resulting from the campaign.
- **Revenue_Generated**: Total revenue generated by the campaign.
- **ROI**: Return on investment for the campaign.
- **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for customers.
- **Subscription_Tier**: The subscription tier of the customer (e.g., basic, premium).
- **Subscription_Length**: Duration of the customer's subscription.
- **Flash_Sale_ID**: Identifier for flash sales associated with the campaign.
- **Discount_Level**: Discount percentage offered during the campaign.
- **Units_Sold**: Number of product units sold during the campaign.
- **Bundle_ID**: Identifier for product bundles.
- **Bundle_Price**: Price of the product bundle.
- **Customer_Satisfaction_Post_Refund**: Customer satisfaction score after refunds (if any).
- **Common_Keywords**: Common keywords used in the campaign.
